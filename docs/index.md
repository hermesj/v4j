## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Hi, in these pages I store thoughts, working notes, rants and frustrations about the [Voynich manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript)
as resulting from my work with the [v4j library](https://github.com/mzattera/v4j).

### Working Notes

- [Note 001 - The Text](./001)

  A short description about how the texts used in the library are obtained; it shows how concordance and majority
  versions of the Voynich transcription are obtained.
  
- [Note 002 - Some Basic Statistics](./002)

  An Excel file with basic page statistics, useful to build pivots.
