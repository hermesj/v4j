The below is my own commented summary from [TILTMAN (1967)](../biblio.md) (mostly a shortened cut & paste from the original).

The original alphabet used by Tiltman is shown below (from [D'IMPERIO (1978b)](../biblio.md), Fig.19); in this summary
I replaced Tiltman's alphabet with [Slots](../005).

From p.7:

* Limited the number of symbols in the transliteration alphabet to 17; most of the alphabet aligns with that used in the First Study Group (FSG).

* It is useless to take account at this stage of rare combinations of
symbols. It is not even in every case possible to say what is a single
symbol and what is not. (e.g. 'a' resolved into 'ei' or possibly 'oi').

* No punctuation at all.

* 'T', 'K', 'P', 'F' appear to be infixes of 't', 'k', 'p', 'f' within 'C'.
I [argued](../005) there is evidence of the opposite, in my opinion.

* 'm' appears most commonly at the end of a line, rarely elsewhere.

* Paragraphs nearly always begin with 'k'-'f' or 't'-'p', most commonly
as 'f', 'p', which also occur frequently in words in
the top lines of paragraphs where there is some extra space.

* 'y' occurs quite frequently as the initial symbol of a line followed
immediately by a combination of symbols which seem to be happy
without it in any part of a line away from the beginning. Otherwise
it occurs chiefly at end of a word, very frequently preceded by 'd'.
Hence the belief that these two have some separative or conjunctive function. 

* However, 'y' also seems sometimes to take the place of 'o' before 
'k'-'f' or 't'-'p' (though rarely, if ever, after 'q');
this is particularly noticeable in some of the captions to illustrations 
in the astronomical section of the manuscript these most commonly begin 'ok'-'of' or 'ot'-'op'
and it is here that we occasionally see 'yk'-'yf' or 'yt'-'yp'.

(e) Tiltman divided words into "roots" and "suffixes".

| Roots			| Are						|
| :---			|:---						|
|ok-, of-		|-an, -ain, -aiin, -aiiin	|
|ot-, op-		|-ar, -air, -aiir, -aiiir	|
|qok-, qof-		|-al, -ail, -aiil, -aiiil	|
|qot-, qop-		|-or						|
|ch-			|-ol						|
|sh-			|-ey, -eey, -eeey			|
|d-				|-edy, -eedy, -eeedy		|
|s-				|							|

" This arrangement is shown at the
bottom of Plate 17. Regarding the second type of suffix, some of the
combinations are so rare that I have been uncertain whether to take
any account of them at all. Some are very common indeed. It seems
to me that each of these combinations beginning A has its own characteristic frequency which it maintains in general
throughout the manuscript and independent of context (except in cases where two or more
A groups are together in series, as referred to later). These A groups,
e.g., AR or AIIL, frequently occur attached directly to "roots,"
particularly OD, OH, 8 and 2. ODAIIL, 40DAIIL and 8AIIL rank
high among the commonest words in the manuscript.

(f) There are however many examples of 2, 3, 4 or even 5 A groups
strung together on end with or without spaces between them. When
this occurs, there appears to be some selective preference. For example,
AR is very frequently doubled, i.e., AR AR, whereas AUL which is
generally significantly commoner, is rarely found doubled. Perhaps
the commonest succession of three of these groups is AR AR AE.
AE very frequently follows AR, but AR hardly ever follows AE.

(g) 0, which has a very common and very definite function in
"roots," seems to occur frequently in "suffixes" in rather similar usage
to A, but nearly always as OR and OE. OR AIIL is very common.

(h) The behaviour of the A (and 0) groups has suggested to me that
they may in fact constitute some form of spelling. It might be, for
instance, that the manuscript is intended to demonstrate some very
primitive universal language and that the author was driven to spell
out the ends of words in order to express the accidence of an inflected
language. If all the possible A and 0 combinations can occur, then
there are 24 possibilities. They may, however, be modified or qualified
in some way by the prefixed symbols D, H, OD, OH, T, S, 8, 2, etc.,
and I have not so far found it possible to draw a line anywhere. This,
coupled with ignorance of the basic language, if any, makes it difficult
to make any sort of attempt at solution, even assuming that there is
spelling.

(i) E, usually preceded by A or 0, is very commonly followed by D,
much less commonly by H, with or without a space between. In this
connection, I have become more and more inclined to believe that a
space, though not intended to deceive, must not necessarily be regarded as a mark of division between two words or concepts.

(j) Speaking generally, each symbol behaves as if it had its own
place in an "order of precedence" within words; some symbols such as
0 and G seem to be able to occupy two functionally different places.

(k) Some of the commoner words, e.g., ODCCG, ODCC8G,
40DCC8G, ODAIIL, ODAR, ODAE, 8AIIL, TCSG occur twice
running, occasionally three times.

(1) I am unable to avoid the conclusion that the occurrence of the
symbol C up to 3 times in one form of "suffix" and the symbol I up to 3
times in the other must have some systematic significance.

(m) Peter Long has suggested to me that the A groups might represent Roman numerals. Thus AHL might be IIJ, and AR AR AE
XXV, but this, if true, would only present one with a set of numbered
categories which doesn't solve the problem. In any case, though it
accounts for the properties of the commoner combinations, it produces
many impossible ones.

(n) The next three plates show pages where the symbols occur singly,
apparently in series, and not in their normal functions. The column
of symbols at the left in PlatÂ£ 18 appears to show a repeating cycle
of6 or 7 symbols D (or H), 0, 2, G, C,?. In Plate 19 the succession of
symbols in the circles must surely have some significance. One circle
has the same series of 17 symbols repeated 4 times. Plate 20 also has
an interesting column of symbols. In all three there are symbols which
rarely, if ever, occur elsewhere.

(o) My analysis, I believe, shows that the text cannot be the result
of substituting single symbols for letters in the natural order. Languages simply do not behave in this way. If the single words attached
to stars in the astronomical drawings, for instance, are really, as they
appear to be, captions expressing the names or qualities of those stars,
there can hardly he any form of transposition system involved. And
yet I am not aware of any long repetitions of more than 2 or 3 words
in succession, as might he expected for instance in the text under the
botanical drawings."
