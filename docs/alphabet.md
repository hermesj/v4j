# The Slot Alphabet

The Slot alphabet is my proposal for a new transliteration alphabet; you can find the reasons behind this proposal in [Note 005](./005).

The alphabet is very similar to Basic EVA, with the difference that some combinations of EVA characters (pedestals,  pedestalled gallows, and sequences of 'i' and 'e') are represented in Slot alphabet by a single 
uppercase letter; these differences are summarized in the table below.

A [transliteration](https://github.com/mzattera/v4j/blob/master/eclipse/io.github.mzattera.v4j/src/main/resources/Transcriptions/Interlinear_slot_ivtff_1.5.txt)
of the Landini-Stolfi interlinear file that uses the Slot alphabet is available within
[v4j library](https://github.com/mzattera/v4j#ivtff) and accessible using `VoynichFactory` factory methods.
